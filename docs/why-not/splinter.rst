title: Why not use splinter?
---

Splinter is a python library designed to provide a nicer wrapper around selenium.

seleniumdirector tries to do approximately the same thing, but it does not attempt
to abstract away selector logic in to a configuration file to clean up the code.

Currently there are certain convenient features of splinter which seleniumdirector
can't do, some of which will be added to future versions.
